# java-hod-client

Java Client for parametric values.

This library consists of two specific use cases of the HOD APIs.

The first is a combination of the Resources Service and the Index Fields Service. This provides indexes,
and for each index its index fields.

The second use case provides the parametric values for a set of given indexes and a set of given index fields.
The client of this library can provide these from the first use case.
